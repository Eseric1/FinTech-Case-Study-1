# Business Activities:
### What Problem Does Circle Solve With USDC ?
* The USDC stablecoin allows finances to move with the speed and convenience of the internet. The creation of USDC allows businesses to use Circle APIs to process transactions while avoiding banking hours, processing times, and high fees. USDC allows an individual with internet access to access decentralized finances and financial services. Customers who meet Know Your Customer (KYC) identity requirements are given the opportunity to link a bank account and make wire transfers in US Dollars to exchanges where then the money is then converted into USDC, allowing the customers to use buy and sell other cryptocurrencies. The customer can convert USDC back into US Dollars and wire the amount back into their bank account.


### Are You A Customer of Circle ?
* Circle intends to acquire customers who are interested in trading or using digital currencies. They have developer tools for companies of all sizes or enterprises that support cryptocurrency payments for USDC to be used. Individuals who want to transact or invest in cryptocurrencies. The market for blockchain is estimated to grow to around USD 60 billion by 2028.  

* USDC seems intent to try to capture as much of that as possible, their biggest competitor by utilization and market cap seems to be tether another stablecoin that claims to be fully backed by equal assets, currently tether handles $30 billion dollars of trading value per 24 hours captured on February 26 of 2023, while USDC handles only $2.4 billion dollars per 24 hours. 
### Why Is USDC The Better Option ?
* USDC has been audited by Grant Thornton, one of the top 10 accounting firms in the world. Showing that the total amount of USDC in circulation is 100% backed which is more secure than even our current banks using the fractional reserve system. USDC is positioned to become the most trusted and well-regulated digital dollar currency.

### What Tech Does USDC Utilize ?

* USDC uses the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)utility that burns USDC on the source chain and mints the same amount of USDC on the other chain in the transaction. Developers can implement (CCTP) into their code and provide users on decentralized apps (Dapps) their most efficient way of transferring USDC across blockchains and simplifying user experiences. CCTP eliminates the regular lock-and-mint bridge, which otherwise locks USDC on the original chain then mints a synthetic/fake version of USDC on the destination chain which obviously implicate security reasons.
